Q:1) There are different situations where one need simulations like (vehicles creation, traffic lights systems, aircraft making, for new technologies creation).

why: e.g (traffic lights system helps the drivers and traffic accumulate time to lower accidents rates. simulation take in account to many more variabilities,
 like rush hours and incidents, it helps in creation of environment where one can test the system without physical damage and analyze and improve their system).



Q2:) Elements like variabilities, complexity and interconnection can be test and improve through simulation. I will associate Special Vehicle example to identify the elements.

Variability elements: production times, supply chain, workforce skills and their availablity.

Complexity elements: Product manufacturing, Resource dependency, safety statndards or regulations to follow.

Interconnectedness elements: 1: Supply chain - Production - Resources

2: design - manufacturing 3: testing - production.
