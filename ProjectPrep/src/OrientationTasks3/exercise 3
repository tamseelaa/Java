A Singleton class ensures only one instance exists.

To enforce this, the constructor is declared private, preventing other classes from calling new.

The only way to obtain the instance is via a static factory method (getInstance()), which checks whether an instance already exists.

If you could call new, youâ€™d break the singleton rule and multiple objects would exist.
