initialize airport system
initialize event list (A-phase: arrivals)

while simulation time < end time:
    get next event from event list
    advance simulation clock to event time

    if event is arrival (A-phase):
        process passenger arrival
        schedule service start if service point free

    if event is service start (B-phase):
        start service (check-in, security, boarding)
        schedule service end

    if event is service end (C-phase):
        finish service
        update statistics (waiting time, utilisation)
        check if queue has waiting passengers
        schedule next service start if queue not empty
