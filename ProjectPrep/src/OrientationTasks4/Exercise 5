Simulator classes & coding phases for airport

Simulator classes:
Passenger, ServicePoint, Event, Simulator, Statistics.

Phases:

A-phase coding (Arrival events):

Passenger enters the airport system.

Example: Event arrival = new Event(time, passenger, ARRIVAL);

B-phase coding (Service start events):

Passenger starts service at check-in, security, boarding.

Example: Event serviceStart = new Event(time, passenger, SERVICE_START);

C-phase coding (Service end events):

Passenger finishes service; update queues and stats.

Example: Event serviceEnd = new Event(time, passenger, SERVICE_END);

Pseudocode:

class Event {
    type (ARRIVAL, SERVICE_START, SERVICE_END)
    time
    passenger
