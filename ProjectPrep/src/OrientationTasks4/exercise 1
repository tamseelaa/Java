Suppose you know the age distribution of students in your group, for example:

Age	Proportion (%)
20	30%
21	40%
22	20%
23	10%

You want to generate 1000 ages so the sample matches this distribution.

Algorithm (inverse transform style with discrete distribution):

Input: table of (age, probability).
Example: (20 → 0.3, 21 → 0.4, 22 → 0.2, 23 → 0.1).

Build cumulative distribution function (CDF):

20 → [0.0, 0.3)

21 → [0.3, 0.7)

22 → [0.7, 0.9)

23 → [0.9, 1.0)

Generate 1000 random numbers (uniform [0,1)):

For each random number r, find which interval it falls into.

Assign the corresponding age.

Store the 1000 values in an array.

Compile statistics (counts per age) and compare them to expected percentages.

This algorithm is direct and ready for coding.
